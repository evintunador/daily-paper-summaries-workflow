### Senper2

This paper explores the evolution of sensation and perception using an artificial life simulation. The researchers built upon the Interface Theory of Perception (ITP), which suggests that organisms evolve to generate perceptions that optimize their survival and reproduction, rather than perceiving the world veridically. The simulation involved robots with separate sensation, perception, and decision-making functions, subject to mutation and fitness-driven selection in a changing environment.

The researchers found that over multiple epochs with varying fitness functions, the robots evolved veridical sensation but non-veridical perception. This suggests that the distinction between sensation and perception is crucial for understanding the evolutionary origins of organisms' representations of the world. The results align with the predictions of ITP and support the idea that organisms evolve to maximize fitness rather than to perceive the world as it is.

The study has potential implications for various fields. In the study of human psychedelic experiences, the findings suggest that altered states of consciousness may involve a shift in the balance between sensation and perception. In the field of artificial intelligence, the research highlights the importance of developing AI models with unique "interfaces" for perceiving the world, rather than striving for veridical perception. The assumption of differential mutation rates for sensation, perception, and decision-making functions is also discussed, as it may impact the findings.

One potential critique of the study is the simplification of sensory and perceptual processes in the simulation. The discrete symbolic representations used for sensation and the binary color code used for perception may not fully capture the complexity of real-world sensory and perceptual systems. Additionally, the specific fitness functions and environmental changes implemented in the simulation may not fully reflect the complexity and variability of natural environments.

Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of the evolutionary pressures that shape organisms' representations of the world. It provides insights into the interplay between sensation and perception and has implications for fields such as neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and the study of consciousness. Further research can explore additional factors and mechanisms that influence the evolution of sensory and perceptual strategies.

### Patents___Ai___Bad 2Nd Draft

This paper explores the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), intellectual property, and proprietary data, and how it challenges the traditional patent system. The paper argues that AI architectures and models bend and break the fundamental assumptions underlying the patent system, in contrast to physical goods. It examines the economic characteristics of AI, including the non-exclusionary nature of digital goods and the role of proprietary data in fostering innovation and competitive advantage.

The paper also discusses the potential benefits and pitfalls of an open-source paradigm for AI, highlighting the successes of open-source software and its alignment with digital goods. It explores the concept of proprietary data as a substitute for intellectual property protections and its potential to act as a key driver of innovation. The paper concludes with potential future directions, including the reevaluation of intellectual property laws, ethical considerations, collaborative innovation models, regulatory oversight, international harmonization, and environmental responsibility.

The core assertions of this paper are that AI architectures and models challenge the assumptions of scarcity, exclusivity, incentives, balance of interests, enforceability, and technological neutrality that underlie the traditional patent system. The paper argues that the non-exclusionary nature of AI and the replicability of AI architectures and models make them fundamentally different from physical goods, and therefore require a reevaluation of patent laws.

The mechanics of the paper involve analyzing the fundamental assumptions of the patent system, examining the economic characteristics of AI, discussing the benefits and pitfalls of an open-source paradigm, exploring the concept of proprietary data, and presenting potential future directions.

The results of the paper suggest that the traditional patent system is not well-suited for AI, as AI architectures and models do not align with the assumptions of scarcity, exclusivity, and enforceability. The paper argues that an open-source paradigm and the use of proprietary data may offer alternative approaches to fostering innovation and protecting intellectual property in the AI field.

Potential critiques of the paper may include concerns about the impact of an open-source paradigm on incentives for innovation, the challenges of defining ownership and novelty in the context of AI architectures and models, and the potential for abuse or misuse of proprietary data.

The implications of this paper are that policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders need to carefully consider the unique challenges and opportunities presented by AI in the context of intellectual property. The paper suggests potential future directions, such as reevaluating patent laws, promoting collaborative innovation models, and addressing ethical considerations and regulatory oversight.

Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the incompatibility of AI research with the traditional patent system, offering valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, industry leaders, and the broader community. It contributes to the ongoing discourse on the evolving landscape of AI, intellectual property, and societal advancement.

### Meta_Evolution_And_Decentralized_Symbiotic_Alignment 2023.5.14

This paper proposes a model of meta-optimization, where optimization algorithms themselves evolve and improve over time. The model defines a function space F, where optimization algorithms operate, and a landscape function L that maps points in F to their fitness. The model considers five parameters of optimization algorithms: the number of agents N, the stochasticity of their movements S, the speed of movement V, the generality of their intelligence G, and the reproduction capability R.

The paper suggests that optimization algorithms optimize and can create new optimization algorithms as subcomponents or successors. The meta-optimization process M is defined as a function that selects the optimization algorithm with the highest propagation within the function space over time. This captures the idea of the "evolution of evolution" or "meta-optimization" where optimization algorithms themselves are subject to optimization and evolution.

The implications of this model include the potential evolution and improvement of AI algorithms themselves. It aligns with current trends in AI research, such as AutoML and Neural Architecture Search, which automate the process of designing and optimizing machine learning models. The model also suggests the emergence of new paradigms of AI as a result of this meta-optimization process.

However, the model raises concerns about AI safety. If AI algorithms can spawn new algorithms that diverge significantly from their parents, it may become challenging to predict and control the behavior of AI systems. This could pose risks in ensuring that AI systems behave safely and in accordance with human values.

The paper acknowledges that the model is highly simplified and abstract, and many details of real-world optimization and evolutionary processes are not captured. It also highlights the need for further research and exploration of the implications and limitations of the model.

Potential critiques of the model include the assumptions made about the nature of the landscape, the behavior of the algorithms, and the relationship between population size and solution quality. The model also does not consider the selection pressure that eliminates poorly optimizing algorithms or the potential utility gained from creating specific algorithms.

In conclusion, this paper presents a model of meta-optimization that suggests the evolution and improvement of AI algorithms themselves. It has implications for the future of AI research and raises concerns about AI safety. However, further research is needed to validate and explore the implications and limitations of the model.

### Subsettable_Enmeshed_Cooperative_Clusters

This paper proposes a meta-organizational structure called Subsettable Enmeshed Cooperative Clusters (SECCs) for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that aims to bridge the gap between capitalism and socialism. SECCs are designed to be easy to set up, highly customizable, modular, interconnected, and dynamic cooperative organizations that can exist as sub or super-structures to each other. The paper suggests that by utilizing blockchain technology and decentralized information, SECCs can address the flaws of both centrally planned economic systems and free market systems.

The paper begins by discussing the motivation behind the idea, highlighting concerns such as wealth inequality, stagnating median income, decreasing socioeconomic class mobility, and the flaws of both capitalism and socialism. It argues that a new system is needed to facilitate information transfer in government and proposes SECCs as a potential solution.

The background section provides an overview of cooperatives, blockchain technology, smart contracts, and DAOs. It explains that cooperatives are people-centered enterprises owned and run by their members to meet their economic, social, and cultural needs. Blockchain technology is described as a decentralized ledger that uses cryptography to ensure the legitimacy of transactions. Smart contracts are introduced as self-executing contracts that are written on the blockchain and cannot be broken. DAOs are explained as organizations that operate based on smart contracts and are governed by their members.

The core idea of SECCs is illustrated through the examples of two organizations: EvCorp and Best Friends Union. The paper discusses the features of SECCs, including their subsettable nature, the ability to function as clusters, enmeshment of different organizations, and the customizability and fluidity of parameters. It also explores the potential emergent effects of SECCs and the feasibility and conditions for their success.

The paper then addresses the flaws of centrally planned economic systems, such as information inefficiency, lack of innovation, bureaucracy, and corruption, and explains how SECCs can mitigate these issues. It also discusses the flaws of free market systems, including wealth inequality, market failure, negative externalities, boom and bust cycles, unhampered growth, and materialism. The paper argues that SECCs can address these flaws by incorporating cooperative structures, decentralized information, and emergent dynamics.

In the brainstorm section, the paper presents specific details and potential instantiations of SECCs, exploring various possibilities and applications. It also discusses potential issues and limitations, including cultural, legal, mechanical, and technical challenges that may arise in implementing SECCs.

The paper concludes by summarizing the main points and emphasizing the need for open-mindedness and exploration of new economic systems. It acknowledges that SECCs are not a perfect solution but suggests that they have the potential to combine the strengths of capitalism and socialism while addressing their respective flaws.

This paper explores the evolution of sensation and perception using an artificial life simulation. The researchers built upon the Interface Theory of Perception (ITP), which suggests that organisms evolve to generate perceptions that optimize their survival and reproduction, rather than perceiving the world veridically. The simulation involved robots with separate sensation, perception, and decision-making functions, subject to mutation and fitness-driven selection in a changing environment.

The researchers found that over multiple epochs with varying fitness functions, the robots evolved veridical sensation but non-veridical perception. This suggests that the distinction between sensation and perception is crucial for understanding the evolutionary origins of organisms' representations of the world. The results align with the predictions of ITP and support the idea that organisms evolve to maximize fitness rather than to perceive the world as it is.

The study has potential implications for various fields. In the study of human psychedelic experiences, the findings suggest that altered states of consciousness may involve a shift in the balance between sensation and perception. In the field of artificial intelligence, the research highlights the importance of developing AI models with unique "interfaces" for perceiving the world, rather than striving for veridical perception. The assumption of differential mutation rates for sensation, perception, and decision-making functions is also discussed, as it may impact the findings.

One potential critique of the study is the simplification of sensory and perceptual processes in the simulation. The discrete symbolic representations used for sensation and the binary color code used for perception may not fully capture the complexity of real-world sensory and perceptual systems. Additionally, the specific fitness functions and environmental changes implemented in the simulation may not fully reflect the complexity and variability of natural environments.

Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of the evolutionary pressures that shape organisms' representations of the world. It provides insights into the interplay between sensation and perception and has implications for fields such as neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and the study of consciousness. Further research can explore additional factors and mechanisms that influence the evolution of sensory and perceptual strategies.

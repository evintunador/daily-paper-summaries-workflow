In this paper, the authors explore the concept of intelligence in both biological and artificial systems. They argue that true intelligence lies in the ability to understand and control collective systems, where many identical sub-systems interact conservatively. The key principle of intelligence, according to the authors, is recognizing the global consequences of local actions.

The authors introduce the idea of collective systems as "twinkling textures" governed by a puppet master. The puppet master represents the intelligent being that controls the collective system, characterized by co-states and states. The flow of the collective system is determined by a geodesic motion of least action, generated by the symmetries of the system.

Controlling collective conservative systems is challenging, and historically, it has been done through the addition of viscosity or friction to stabilize the system. However, this approach degrades or destroys the system's performance. The authors propose an alternative method called "ponderomotive control," which involves quickly vibrating the collective system according to its optimal twinkling textures. This approach allows the system to remain at a meta stable equilibrium without the need for excessive viscosity.

The paper also discusses the application of these concepts to economic and social collectives. It argues that well-educated intelligence understands the long-term consequences of actions and avoids short-term optimizations that may lead to poor outcomes. In contrast, trained intelligence or "trained stupidity" focuses on short-term gains, leading to negative long-term consequences.

The authors highlight the importance of recent technical developments such as electronic currency and true artificial intelligence, which have revolutionized the control of collective systems. They also mention the Heisenberg Scattering Transformation and its associated ponderomotive control as additional tools for efficient control.

Overall, the paper suggests that intelligence lies in understanding and controlling collective systems, and well-educated intelligence is inherently good. The authors emphasize the need to move away from viscous control methods and embrace more efficient and intelligent approaches.

Potential critiques of the paper may include the need for further empirical evidence to support the claims made and a more detailed exploration of the limitations and challenges of implementing the proposed control methods. Additionally, the paper could benefit from clearer explanations of the technical concepts and their relevance to the broader discussion on intelligence and collective systems.

The implications of this research are significant, as it offers insights into the nature of intelligence and its application to various domains, including economics and social systems. It suggests that a shift towards intelligent control methods can lead to more efficient and sustainable outcomes.

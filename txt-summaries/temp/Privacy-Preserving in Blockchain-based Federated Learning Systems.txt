This paper is a comprehensive survey that explores the integration of Federated Learning (FL) and Blockchain technology to preserve privacy in collaborative machine learning environments. FL is a novel approach where multiple participants train a global model without sharing their local data, while Blockchain provides a decentralized and secure platform for data storage and tracking. The paper reviews the existing literature on privacy attacks in Blockchain-enabled FL systems and the countermeasures proposed to protect privacy. It also discusses the practical applications of Blockchain-enabled FL in various domains, such as healthcare and the Internet of Things. The survey identifies the main challenges and future directions in this field and provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners.

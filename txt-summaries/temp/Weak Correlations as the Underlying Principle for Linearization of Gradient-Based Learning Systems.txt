This paper explores the phenomenon of linearization in gradient descent-based learning systems, particularly in wide neural networks. The authors propose that the underlying principle for this linearization is weak correlations between the first and higher-order derivatives of the hypothesis function with respect to the parameters. They define the concept of derivative correlations, which quantifies these weak correlations.

The authors prove that wide neural networks indeed exhibit this weak derivative correlations structure. They introduce a novel method to characterize the asymptotic behavior of random tensors, which is crucial for their analysis. They also derive a bound on the deviation from linearity during the training trajectory of stochastic gradient descent, which is a generalization of the traditional result for deterministic gradient descent.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
1. The establishment of the equivalence between linearity and weak derivative correlations in gradient descent-based learning systems.
2. The proof that wide neural networks display this weak derivative correlations structure.
3. The demonstration of how modifications in the architecture of linearizing learning systems, such as wide neural networks, affect the rate of linearization.
4. The derivation of a bound on the deviation from linearity during learning using stochastic gradient descent.
5. The introduction of the notion of random tensor asymptotic behavior as an effective analytical tool.

The implications of this work suggest that weak derivative correlations could be the fundamental cause for the prevalent linearization attributes observed in wide neural networks and other linearizing systems. It provides insights into the behavior of gradient descent-based learning algorithms and sheds light on the relationship between linearity and weak correlations.

Potential critiques of this work could include the assumptions made about the system, such as the convexity of the cost function and the analytical nature of the hypothesis function. Additionally, the applicability of the results to real-world data and the generalizability of the findings to other learning algorithms and architectures may need further investigation.

Overall, this paper contributes to our understanding of the linearization phenomenon in gradient descent-based learning systems and provides a framework for analyzing the behavior of wide neural networks. It offers valuable insights into the underlying principles of these systems and opens up avenues for further research in this area.

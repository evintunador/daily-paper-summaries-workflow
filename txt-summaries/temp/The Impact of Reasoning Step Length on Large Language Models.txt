In this research paper, the authors investigate the impact of reasoning step length on the performance of large language models (LLMs) using the Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting technique. CoT is known for its effectiveness in improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs in various complex NLP tasks. However, the relationship between the length of reasoning steps in prompts and the performance of CoT remains unclear.

To address this, the authors conduct several empirical experiments to explore the correlation between reasoning step length and CoT performance. They design experiments that expand and compress the reasoning steps within CoT demonstrations while keeping all other factors constant. The experiments are conducted in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

The key findings of the study are as follows:

1. Lengthening the reasoning steps in prompts significantly enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities across multiple datasets. Even without introducing new information, increasing the number of steps improves the accuracy of problem-solving. Conversely, shortening the reasoning steps, even while preserving key information, diminishes the reasoning abilities of models. This highlights the importance of the number of steps in CoT prompts and provides practical guidance for optimizing CoT performance.

2. Surprisingly, even incorrect rationales can yield favorable outcomes if they maintain the requisite length of inference. This suggests that the length of the thinking chain is more critical than the accuracy of individual reasoning steps.

3. The advantages of increasing reasoning steps are task-dependent. Simpler tasks require fewer steps, while more complex tasks benefit significantly from longer inference sequences.

4. Increasing the reasoning steps in zero-shot CoT prompts also improves LLM accuracy. By modifying the initial prompt to encourage more extensive thinking, the authors observed a noticeable enhancement in reasoning abilities, particularly in datasets involving mathematical problems.

The implications of these findings are significant for the field of NLP and CoT prompting. The study provides a systematic understanding of the impact of reasoning step length on CoT performance, offering practical guidance for optimizing CoT prompts in complex problem-solving scenarios. The findings also highlight the importance of the length of the thinking chain in CoT, rather than the accuracy of individual reasoning steps.

One potential critique of the study is the reliance on empirical experiments without a deep theoretical analysis of the underlying mechanisms. While the findings provide valuable insights, further research is needed to understand the precise mechanisms through which reasoning step length influences CoT performance.

Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of CoT prompting and provides valuable insights for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models in complex NLP tasks. The findings have practical implications for the design and optimization of CoT prompts, enabling better utilization of LLMs' potential in problem-solving scenarios.

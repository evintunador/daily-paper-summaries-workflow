The paper discusses the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for social networks, focusing on three categories of tasks: knowledge tasks, engagement tasks, and foundation tasks. The authors provide insights into the challenges faced in developing LLM applications for social networks and propose solutions based on their experience at Nextdoor, a hyper-local social network.

In the knowledge tasks category, the authors introduce the LocalGPT system, which is designed to provide neighborhood-specific knowledge and answer users' questions about their neighborhoods. To address the limitations of existing LLMs, the authors employ Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), which retrieves relevant documents from the Nextdoor data and uses them to generate answers. The authors also propose a fine-tuning approach to train the LLMs with Nextdoor-specific instructions and preferences. They further develop an automatic evaluation system to assess the quality of the generated answers.

In the engagement tasks category, the authors focus on increasing user engagement by creating interesting content. They develop a reward model that predicts user interaction with the content generated by LLMs. The reward model is periodically retrained to adapt to changing user preferences.

In the foundation tasks category, the authors address tasks that are essential for operating social networks, such as content annotation and LLM monitoring. They discuss the construction of a local knowledge graph and the development of a centralized API for LLMs. They also optimize the cost of LLM serving and implement efficient LLM performance monitoring.

The paper provides detailed explanations of the challenges faced in each task category and the solutions developed by the authors. It also includes experimental results and discussions on the deployment considerations of the proposed solutions.

Overall, the paper offers valuable insights into the development of LLM applications for social networks, highlighting the challenges and providing practical solutions based on real-world experiences. The proposed approaches can be useful for other social network platforms looking to leverage LLMs for various tasks.

This paper discusses the potential role of higher-order cognitive models in active learning, particularly in the context of human feedback. The authors propose a taxonomy of interaction involving different levels of cognition, ranging from level 1 (literal active learning) to level 5 (pragmatic inference). They argue that incorporating higher-order cognitive models can enhance AI-human interaction and improve the sample efficiency of active learning.

The paper presents a case study of active learning with preference queries in a recommender system for a car shopping website. They model the human as a level 3 agent, capable of inferring the belief of the active learning system and employing theory of mind reasoning for strategic teaching. The active learning system is modeled as a level 2 agent, which adapts its questions based on its belief about the human's preferences.

The results of the case study show that the belief of the active learning system can be identified by the level 3 human model, even when queries aim to reduce uncertainty about one group only. The authors also demonstrate how identifiability is affected by uncertainty regarding the group, resulting in queries that aim to reduce uncertainty about both the group and the modes.

The implications of this work are that incorporating higher-order cognitive models in active learning can lead to more efficient AI-human interaction. By modeling the human's beliefs and intentions, AI systems can ask more informative questions and learn more effectively from human feedback. This has potential applications in various domains where active learning from human feedback is used.

One potential critique of this work is that the case study is limited to a specific scenario of preference queries in a car shopping website. It would be beneficial to explore the applicability of higher-order cognitive models in other types of active learning scenarios and domains. Additionally, the computational study could be complemented with user studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in real-world interactions.

In conclusion, this paper highlights the potential of incorporating higher-order cognitive models in active learning for human feedback. The proposed taxonomy and case study provide insights into the benefits and challenges of using such models in AI-human interaction. Further research in this direction can lead to more efficient and effective AI systems that can collaborate with humans in a wide range of tasks.

This paper explores the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), intellectual property, and proprietary data, and how it challenges the traditional patent system. The paper argues that AI architectures and models bend and break the fundamental assumptions underlying the patent system, in contrast to physical goods. It examines the economic characteristics of AI, including the non-exclusionary nature of digital goods and the role of proprietary data in fostering innovation and competitive advantage.

The paper also discusses the potential benefits and pitfalls of an open-source paradigm for AI, highlighting the successes of open-source software and its alignment with digital goods. It explores the concept of proprietary data as a substitute for intellectual property protections and its potential to act as a key driver of innovation. The paper concludes with potential future directions, including the reevaluation of intellectual property laws, ethical considerations, collaborative innovation models, regulatory oversight, international harmonization, and environmental responsibility.

The core assertions of this paper are that AI architectures and models challenge the assumptions of scarcity, exclusivity, incentives, balance of interests, enforceability, and technological neutrality that underlie the traditional patent system. The paper argues that the non-exclusionary nature of AI and the replicability of AI architectures and models make them fundamentally different from physical goods, and therefore require a reevaluation of patent laws.

The mechanics of the paper involve analyzing the fundamental assumptions of the patent system, examining the economic characteristics of AI, discussing the benefits and pitfalls of an open-source paradigm, exploring the concept of proprietary data, and presenting potential future directions.

The results of the paper suggest that the traditional patent system is not well-suited for AI, as AI architectures and models do not align with the assumptions of scarcity, exclusivity, and enforceability. The paper argues that an open-source paradigm and the use of proprietary data may offer alternative approaches to fostering innovation and protecting intellectual property in the AI field.

Potential critiques of the paper may include concerns about the impact of an open-source paradigm on incentives for innovation, the challenges of defining ownership and novelty in the context of AI architectures and models, and the potential for abuse or misuse of proprietary data.

The implications of this paper are that policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders need to carefully consider the unique challenges and opportunities presented by AI in the context of intellectual property. The paper suggests potential future directions, such as reevaluating patent laws, promoting collaborative innovation models, and addressing ethical considerations and regulatory oversight.

Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the incompatibility of AI research with the traditional patent system, offering valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, industry leaders, and the broader community. It contributes to the ongoing discourse on the evolving landscape of AI, intellectual property, and societal advancement.
